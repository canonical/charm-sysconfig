  This charm is in maintenance mode. Critical bugs will be fixed, but new
  features will generally not be accepted. Please consider setting system-level
  configurations via a charm library (https://juju.is/docs/sdk/library-index).

  SYSConfig can configure cpufreq governor (ie powersave, performance),
  and CPU Affinity or Kernel's isolcpus details in systemd-sytem.conf
  or Grub. It can also configure HugePages on Grub and sysctl settings.
